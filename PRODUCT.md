## Users

**Primary**: AI engineers and agent framework developers building RAG pipelines, agentic memory systems, or knowledge-augmented LLM applications. They are technical, pragmatic, and skeptical of "AI infrastructure" hype.

**Secondary**: Technical decision-makers (CTOs, lead engineers) evaluating embedded database options. They care about latency, durability, and total operational cost.

**Context**: Users arrive from GitHub, PyPI, or LLM-generated recommendations. They are mid-scroll, comparison-shopping, or debugging a pain point (e.g., "six databases to do one thing"). The site must answer quickly: *what is this, why do I need it, and how do I install it.*

## Product Purpose

VantaDB is an embedded Rust engine for AI agents — a single binary that unifies hybrid search (BM25 + HNSW), GraphRAG, and crash-safe WAL durability. No servers, no microservices, no orchestration. `pip install vantadb-py` and it runs in-process.

The core insight: AI agents shouldn't need six databases (vector, SQL, full-text, graph, cache, queue) to manage one context window. VantaDB collapses that stack into one embedded engine.

Success looks like: a developer installs it in under 60 seconds, understands the API in under 5 minutes, and never reaches for a separate vector DB again.

## Brand Personality

Profunda · Intelectual · Elegante

Deep without being academic. Intellectual without being cold. Elegant without being decorative.

The voice is that of an expert engineer who communicates with precision and conviction — not marketing fluff, not academic jargon. Sentences are short when they need to be, technical when precision demands it, and confident without arrogance.

Emotional goals when someone lands on the site:
- **Trust**: this is built by people who understand databases and AI at a systems level
- **Curiosity**: I want to see how this works under the hood
- **Clarity**: I immediately understand the value proposition and the install path

## Anti-references

- **SaaS genérico**: No Hubspot/Webflow template energy. No generic hero-metric templates, no stock illustrations, no "glassmorphism because it looks modern."
- **Corporate frío**: No IBM/Microsoft/Oracle cold professionalism. No navy-and-white corporate minimalism. No photos of smiling diverse teams in meeting rooms.
- **Académico aburrido**: No dense walls of prose, no footnote-heavy layouts, no beige paper textures that signal "research paper."

## Design Principles

1. **Editorial confidence** — Typography leads. Headings are large but never shout. White space is structural, not decorative. The page reads like a premium technology monograph, not a SaaS landing page.

2. **Motion as language** — Every animation serves comprehension: scroll reveals show relationships, parallax communicates depth, micro-interactions acknowledge intent. If an animation doesn't help the user understand something faster, it doesn't exist.

3. **Developer-first, always** — The install command is the hero CTA. Code snippets are real and runnable. Technical depth is a feature, not something to hide behind marketing copy. Show the API, don't describe it.

4. **Dark with purpose** — Dark mode isn't a default because "tools look cool dark." It's dark because AI engineers live in dark terminals, dark IDEs, dark docs. The amber accent echoes a terminal cursor, a compile glow, a signal in the dark. Every color choice has a reason rooted in the user's environment.

5. **Differentiation through restraint** — VantaDB's advantage is *simplicity* (one engine, one binary). The design must embody that: fewer sections than competitors, clearer copy, faster path to install. Every element that doesn't help a developer decide or install is removed.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG 2.2 AA minimum (contrast ≥ 4.5:1 body text, ≥ 3:1 large text)
- `prefers-reduced-motion` respected globally — all animations degrade gracefully to crossfade or instant reveal
- Keyboard-navigable navigation with visible focus indicators
- Semantic HTML structure
- Dark theme as default — no forced light/dark toggle assumed
